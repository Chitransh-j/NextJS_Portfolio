## This is my Portoflio as a full Stack Developer

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


- I have used Nextjs for SEO.
- Tailwind for Faster Styling.
- TypeScript for Type-safety.
- Custom Hooks for Abstraction for logics.
- Framer motion for advanced animations.
- Dark Mode and Light Mode that persists as you reload and initally adjusts to your device theme.
- Deployed on Vercel.

> The Portfolio is made to meet with the *Modern Standards* of TypeScript, Nextjs and Tailwind.
